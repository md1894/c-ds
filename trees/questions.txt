Print Level Wise
Send Feedback
Given a generic tree, print the input tree in level wise order. ####For printing a node with data N, you need to follow the exact format -
N:x1,x2,x3,...,xn
wherer, N is data of any node present in the binary tree. x1, x2, x3, ...., xn are the children of node N
There is no space in between.
You need to print all nodes in the level order form in different lines.
Input format :
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Level wise print
Sample Input :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output :
10:20,30,40
20:40,50
30:
40:
40:
50:

Code : Find sum of nodes
Send Feedback
Given a generic tree, count and return the sum of all nodes present in the given tree.
Input format :

Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Sum of all nodes
Sample Input :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output :
190



Code : Max data node
Send Feedback
Given a generic tree, find and return the node with maximum data. You need to return the complete node which is having maximum data.
Return null if tree is empty.
Input format :
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Node with largest data
Sample Input :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output :
50


Code : Find height
Send Feedback
Given a generic tree, find and return the height of given tree.
Input format :
Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 
Output Format :
Height
Sample Input :
10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 
Sample Output :
3
